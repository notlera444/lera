            Hello, my name is Valeria Cioara. I am a student in 10th grade in Orizont Lyceum.
             I live in Moldova, Chisinau. Living in Chisinau, Moldova, you experience a unique blend of history and culture. 
             The capital city, nestled between rolling hills, showcases a mix of Soviet-era architecture and vibrant, welcoming communities. 
             Moldova's rich traditions, influenced by both Eastern Europe and its own distinct identity, likely shape your daily life.
              From exploring historical sites to enjoying the local cuisine, there's a diverse tapestry of experiences in this Eastern European gem. 
              My hobbies are basketball, swimming and cooking. Basketball and swimming are fantastic for staying physically fit, and they offer both competition and relaxation.
               Cooking, on the other hand, is a creative and rewarding pursuit. Something about me is the love I feel for my friends and family is the bedrock of my existence. 
               Their presence adds a vibrant and irreplaceable color to the canvas of my life.
                The shared laughter, the comforting embraces, and the collective strength in facing life's challenges form the essence of my deepest connections.
                In every shared moment, I find a reservoir of joy, support, and understanding that shapes who I am. 
                These relationships are not just a part of my life; they are the heartbeats that give rhythm to my journey, making every step more meaningful and memorable.

            My educational journey took an interesting turn as I initially studied at Erudio until the third grade.
             Subsequently, I transitioned to Orizont, a move that brought its unique set of experiences.
              What added a distinctive twist to my academic path was starting school at the age of five, a decision that led to repeating the third grade upon changing schools. 
              This adjustment brought challenges, but it also allowed me to approach my studies with a fresh perspective. 
              Navigating the transition between educational institutions provided me with valuable insights, shaping not only my academic resilience but also fostering adaptability in the face of change.
             Each chapter in my educational history contributes to the narrative of my growth and learning.
